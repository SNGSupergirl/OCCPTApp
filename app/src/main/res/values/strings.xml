    <string name="about_us_text">AFSCME Child Care Providers Together is the union for Oregon\'s family child care providers. We know Oregon doesn\'t work without child care, and we connect families with union child care providers across Oregon. Families choose to find child care through AFSCME-CCPT because our member providers offer high-quality, developmentally appropriate, affordable care. When providers join us, they don\'t just enjoy the benefits of joining a union — they join a network of union families across the state.</string>
