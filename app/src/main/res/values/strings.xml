    <string name="about_us_title">ABOUT US</string>
    <string name="about_us_text">AFSCME Child Care Providers Together is the union for Oregons family child care providers. We know Oregon doesnt work without child care, and we connect families with union child care providers across Oregon. Families choose to find child care through AFSCME-CCPT because our member providers offer high-quality, developmentally appropriate, affordable care. When providers join us, they dont just enjoy the benefits of joining a union — they join a network of union families across the state.</string>

    <string name="member_1_quote">"I am Registered family daycare which allows me to care for a maximum of 10 children. I am a member of Oregon Child Care Providers Together because it is smaller family child care homes that provide specialized and individualized care, who need to be supported so we can grow our business or feel supported as a business owner."</string>

    <string name="member_2_quote">"We call our program, not a daycare, not a business but our labor of love. Love is the main reason why we do what we do. Our goal is not only to be the child care providers but to be like a second family to our children. We joined the union because in difficult times we know they have our backs!"</string>
